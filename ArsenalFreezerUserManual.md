## Introduction to Arsenal ##

### What is Arsenal? ###

Arsenal is the program we use to monitor all the work the artists need rendered on the farm.

### GUI Overview ###

This manual will go over each button, its functions and all the windows in Arsenal. This will be just a quick overview of the GUI, each part will have a detailed description in specified chapter in the manual as seen in the contents above.

Arsenal has two views, **Job View** and **Host View**.

![http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Arsenal_Overview_EDITED.jpg](http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Arsenal_Overview_EDITED.jpg)

The above screenshot is in **Job View**, which has 3 main windows.
  1. Job list Window - This lists all the jobs going on the farm in rows with details listed in columns.
  1. Specific Job Window - Shows details of the job which is currently selected in the job list window (1.) This window has 5 tabs.
  1. Freezer - This displays the frame currently selected in the Specific Job Window (2.) This window does not show frames all the time, depends on what the selected job is. **EDIT** This window now has tabs, one for the image viewer and the other is for graphs that display frame render times, memory used and disk read and write speeds.

Here is the **Host List\*Overview:**

### Tools ###

#### Overview ####

![http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Arsenal_Drop_Down_Menu_Tools.jpg](http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Arsenal_Drop_Down_Menu_Tools.jpg)

| **Menu Option** | **Description** |
|:----------------|:----------------|
| **Host Service Matrix** | A list of all hosts, their current status and the services that can be run on them. |
| **User Service Matrix** | Lists all users on the far left column and what services have been allowed for that persons use. |
| **Project Weighting** | Lists the weights for projects. |
| **Project Reserve** | Lists the slot reserves for projects. |

#### Host Service Matrix ####

Lists all of the nodes (farm blades, users machines, ...), their current status and the services that can be run on them.

![http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Host_Service_Matrix.jpg](http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Host_Service_Matrix.jpg)

The host is listed on the far left column with its current status. The following columns are the services which are either Enabled, Disabled or No Service for that specific computer. Above are 2 filters you can use to find a Host or Service quickly. The above image has an example of how the filter works.


#### User Service Matrix ####

Lists all users on the far left column and what services have been allowed for that persons use.

![http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/User_Service_Matrix.jpg](http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/User_Service_Matrix.jpg)

The limit is given as a number and determines the maximum number of slots that are allowed for use in the farm.

### Options ###

![http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Arsenal_Drop_Down_Menu_Options.jpg](http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Arsenal_Drop_Down_Menu_Options.jpg)

| **Auto refresh Toggle** | Toggles the list refreshing automatically. The list will refresh every time you switch tabs and every 5 minutes by default. The settings of the auto refresh can be changed in the settings part of the options drop down menu. |
|:------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Show Dependency Tree** | Toggles displaying the dependant jobs in a tree. This is also accessible on the toolbar. |
| **New View From Selection** | This function is currently broken. It is suppose to create a new tab with the job(s) currently selected, so they are displayed on their own in a separate tab. |
| **View My Jobs** | Filters the list to display jobs owned by you. This option is also on the toolbar. |
| **Filter** | Toggles the Filter fields located above the main window. Shift+F is the shortcut. |
| **Clear Filter** | A set of options to specify which projects, job status and job types are displayed in the current view. These supersede any currently applied filter fields. It is recommended to filter out done jobs since there are quite a lot of done jobs. |
| **Job Filters** | A set of options to specify which projects, job status and job types are displayed in the current view. These supersede any currently applied filter fields. It is recommended to filter out done jobs since there are quite a lot of done jobs. |
| **Display Preferences** | Change font and colour of the text for the jobs displayed. Purely for personal taste. Wrangler POV: Could help to quickly differentiate failing jobs. |
| **Settings** | Option to change the job display limit and to configure the Auto Refresh. Having a higher display limit increases time the refresh takes to load. The Auto refresh interval is by default 5 minutes. The other two auto refresh options are self explanatory. |

## Main Job View Window ##

### Job List View ###

The Main window of the Farm User Interface is broken up into many rows and columns which display various bits of information relating to a job that has been submitted to the farm for rendering. ![http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Main_Window.jpg](http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Main_Window.jpg)

Jobs in the main window all have a colour applied to them, which relates to the current status of the job.

These are customizable by the individual user, but by default are:

##### Packets #####

###### Packet Type: ######

There are 4 kind of packet type:

  * **Random:**

Frames are picked up randomly by the farm to be rendered.

<u>Example</u>: For a job with 200 frames, the farm will start rendering frame #145, then #2, etc...



  * **Continuous:**

Each set of frames (as per packet size) is rendered once at a time in an orderly manner.

<u>Example</u>: for a job with 20 frames with a packet size set to 5. Frame #1 to #5 will be rendered on a machine each at a time while frame #6 to #10 will be rendered on another machine each at a time as well.



  * **Sequential:**

This is a mix between random and continuous. It will take #number of frames randomly according to packet size to render them.

<u>Example</u>: if a job has 20 frames to render and a packet size set to 5, frames #10, #7, #19, #3 and #11 will be assigned to one machine, frames #12, #17, #1, #9 and #13 to another machine etc...



  * **Iterative:**

Frames are picked up every 10 frames.

This way, it helps having a quicker overview of the job rendered.

In this case, the packet size will always set to 1.

<u>Example</u>: if a job contains 30 frames, frames #1, #10, #20 and #30 will first be rendered, then frames #2, #11, #21 and so on so forth.

###### Packet Size ######

Number of frames send to 1 machine.

<u>Example</u>: job had 200 frame, if packet size=200 all the frame will be render on 1 machine.

###### Slots ######

A slot is a CPU core on a blade. Each blade has a 8 or 12 core CPU.

Rendering usually uses 8 slots (so 8 CPU cores) so there are 4 CPU that aren’t normally used. However, those left-overs can be used to render low priority jobs such as a still frame.

This field is related to the memory field under “Health Checks” part of the Job Settings tab.

Usually, a rendering job on 8 slots can use up to 16Gb of memory. A rendering job on 4 slots will use 8Gb.

##### Heath Checks #####

| **Max Task Minutes** | Max time allocated to render a single frame. |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| **Max Load Minutes** | Max load time allowed before suspension by the farm. |
| **Max Quiet Minutes** | Max quiet time allowed before suspension by the farm. |
| **Min Memory (MB)** | Min amount of memory to render a frame. |
| **Max Memory (MB)** | Max amount of memory allowed to render a frame on the farm. |
| **Max Errors** | Max numbers of allowed errors before suspension by the farm. |

##### Services #####

Name of the job type.

#### Graphs ####

Once you select a job in the main job view, two windows open, the bottom right window has two tabs. The first tab is the Image viewer, which shows the finished frame once completed, the other tab displays 4 useful graphs. The frame numbers are displayed on the X axis of each graph, with each colour coded bars representing a single frame. Hovering your mouse over these individual bars displays more accurate information about the frame.

![http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Graphs.jpg](http://wiki.arsenalsuite.googlecode.com/hg/images/Graphs.jpg)

(These graphs indicate this job has completed its 10's without any failed frames and now has begun rendering all the frames. The concentrated areas of yellow bars are completed sections of the scene while the green section is currently rendering )

##### Frame Times (minutes) #####

This graph displays the amount of time the frame has taken/taking to render. It shows both CPU time (lighter coloured bar) and Wallclock time (darker coloured bar).

##### Frame Memory (MB) #####

This graph displays the amount of memory (RAM) the frame used when rendering.

##### Disk Read/Write (Ops and MB) #####

These 2 graphs display the read/write. Ops is Opererations the blade made for that frame, such as retrieving files. MB just shows how much was read/written to the disk. The bars going up (lighter colour) display how much was read and going down (darker colour) display how much was written. &nbsp;

##### Bars #####

Each bar in the graphs represents one frame, these bars are also colour coded based on status.

> Yellow is done

> Green is busy

> Blue is cancelled

> Red is suspended

> Frames that are new/holding are not displayed
